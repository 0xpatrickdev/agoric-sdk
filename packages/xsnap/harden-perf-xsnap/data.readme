The 'turing-node-data.json' file was created by running

 yarn test -v -s test/test-harden-perf.js |& tee test.out

and then manually stripping out all the test-runner (ava) notes, failed
tests, and then editing the rest to be valid JSON.

This was run on my local linux box 'turing', the same as
../harden-perf-node/turing-node-data.json .
